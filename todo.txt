* Optimize GeomCompiler. Hash vertex search? Speedup removing duplicate indices. (Or prevent duplicate indices).
* optimize bezier algo to use polynomial stuff, integration, derivatives, etc..
* shared planes in CCompiledBsp?
* shared planes in CCompiledMesh?
* NURBS class.
* Texture coordinates generator.
	- Sphere (position).
	- Cilinder (position, direction).
	- Cube (position).
	- Plane (position, normal).
	- Auto-plane (position, either _|_ X, _|_ Y or _|_ z).
	- Cubemap (position.. texture[6]).
* Change CMatrix to CMatrixStack and implement CMatrix3 and CMatrix4.
* Move CIsosurface code into header.
* Octree class that splits nodes with volume > treshold. Bounding box. Uses bounding box's largest dimension to get splitting plane.
* Reorganize code, so REAL inline stuff gets compiled inline. Other code willhave to be inc'ed with marstd.cpp.
* Maybe a voxel class..
